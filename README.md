📝 Project Title
Real-Time Translation Service 

📌 Abstract
In today’s globalized world, real-time language translation plays a crucial role in eliminating communication barriers across different languages. This project presents a Real-Time Translation Service that allows users to input text in one language and receive instant translations in multiple target languages. Built using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Jinja2, the system provides both a RESTful API and a simple web-based UI for user interaction.

The service is capable of handling translation tasks asynchronously and stores all requests and responses for future tracking. The architecture is modular, scalable, and can be integrated into larger applications such as multilingual chatbots, customer support portals, and educational platforms.

🎯 Objective
To design and develop a system that performs real-time translation of input text into multiple languages.

To offer an intuitive and responsive web interface for user interaction.

To implement asynchronous processing of translation requests for improved performance.

To store translation history using a relational database for auditability and tracking.

To build a RESTful backend that can be integrated with external apps or platforms.

🛠 Technologies Used
Component	Technology
Backend API	FastAPI (Python)
Web Server	Uvicorn (ASGI Server)
Template Engine	Jinja2
Database	PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy ORM
Translation API	Google Translate / Custom
Asynchronous Tasks	FastAPI BackgroundTasks
Frontend (optional)	HTML, Bootstrap (via templates)

🧠 System Architecture Overview
User Input: A user enters a block of text and selects target languages.

API Request: A RESTful POST request is sent to the FastAPI backend.

Translation Engine: The system processes each language translation using an external or internal translation function.

Database Storage: The original text and translations are stored in a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy.

Real-Time Status: The user can query the status or result of their request via request ID.

🔄 Workflow
/translate: Accepts text and target languages, queues the request, and returns a request_id.

/result/{request_id}: Returns the translated text once processing is complete.

UI renders the results using Jinja2 for user-friendly output.

📁 Key Modules
main.py: Entry point of the FastAPI server. Contains routes and logic for translation handling.

utils.py: Functions for text translation and request processing.

models.py: SQLAlchemy models for TranslationRequest, TranslationResult, and IndividualTranslations.

schemas.py: Pydantic schemas for data validation and request/response typing.

database.py: Manages the database connection and session logic.

📊 Advantages
